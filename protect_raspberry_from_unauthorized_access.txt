## To protect raspberry from being accessed by non-authorized hosts
## we set up strict arptable ruleset for any incoming traffic
## might need to be installed first by:
## 'apt-get install arptables' 
##
		## Do this locally with keyboard and NOT BY SSH - connection gets dropped with next command:
		#arptables -P INPUT DROP
		##first get arp -n and check MAC address of FF-Node you are connected to
		#arptables -A INPUT --source-mac <FF-Node mac-adress> -j ACCEPT
		##take mac adresses from arp -n that should also be allowed to connect
		# arptables -A INPUT --source-mac <allowed mac-adress> -j ACCEPT
		## List current table
		#arptables -L -n 
		## Save curent table to file
		# arptables-save >arptables.pi
		## Restore arptables setting
		# cat arptables.pi | arptables-restore
